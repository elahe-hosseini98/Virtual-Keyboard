# Virtual Keyboard with Hand Gesture Control

**Virtual Keyboard with Hand Gesture Control** is a Python application that enables users to control an on-screen keyboard using hand gestures. The program leverages computer vision techniques to detect hand movements through a webcam, simulating key presses and allowing for intuitive, touch-free typing. Ideal for interactive applications and accessibility solutions, this project demonstrates a practical application of gesture-based controls.

## Features

- **On-Screen Keyboard**: Displays a virtual keyboard overlay on the webcam feed, allowing users to see which keys they are interacting with in real-time.

- **Gesture-Based Key Selection**: Detects the distance between thumb and index finger to identify selected keys, simulating a "press" action when the fingers come close enough.

- **Caps Lock and Special Keys**: Provides toggle functionality for Caps Lock, and includes key actions like `Enter`, `Space`, and `Delete`.

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Shows live webcam feed with overlaid keyboard, allowing users to see the selected keys and interact seamlessly.

## How to Run the Application

After cloning the project, navigate to the root directory and run `main.py` to start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Requirements

To run the application, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless mediapipe pillow numpy
```
Ensure you also have the necessary keyboard character images in the `statics/keys/small/png` directory.

## Application Logic Overview

1. **Webcam Feed and Keyboard Display**: 
   The application captures the webcam feed and displays it along with a virtual keyboard overlay. The feed is continuously updated as the user moves their hand.

2. **Gesture Detection and Key Selection**: 
   Using hand tracking, the program identifies the thumb and index finger positions. If the thumb and index finger come close enough while pointing at a key, the key is "pressed."

3. **Caps Lock and Key Label Updates**:
   The app supports a Caps Lock feature that changes the keyboard labels dynamically to uppercase or lowercase. The `CAPSLOCK` state is updated based on user interaction.

4. **Output File**:
   All typed characters are saved to `output/output.txt`, capturing the text generated by the user's interactions with the virtual keyboard.

5. **Dynamic Key Layout Adjustment**:
   If the window is resized, the layout of the keys adjusts proportionally to maintain usability and visual clarity.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: Core application file that initializes the webcam feed, processes hand gestures, and handles virtual key interactions.
- **preload_key_labels.py**: Preloads images of keys for faster rendering and access during runtime.
- **keyboard.py**: Defines methods for creating the keyboard layout on the webcam feed.
- **get_selected_key.py**: Determines which key is selected based on finger distance.
- **touch_detector/**: Manages hand landmark detection and gesture-based input recognition.
